### Descripcion ###

Nobita needs help again. This time he got on the wrong flight on his way back from his vacation in Madrid. He was running out of battery, and rushed to send Doraemon a photo from the window. Nobita does not know where he is or how much flight time is left!

To be able to use the anywhere door, Doraemon has to know the airport from the photo (3 letter code), Nobita's flight code and the hour of arrival to the final unknown destination (the hour it actually arrived, not the expected hour)
